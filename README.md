### 🧠 Mentality & Philosophy

- **Relentless Learner:** I thrive in the "uncomfortable zone" where technology moves faster than the documentation. I don't just use tools; I seek to understand their limits.
- **Efficiency Obsessed:** If a task can be automated, it should be. I build workflows that allow humans to focus on creativity while machines handle the repetition.
- **Logic + Ethics:** My work is driven by a balance of scientific rigor and ethical responsibility. I believe technology should serve people, not just metrics.
- **Resilience:** Born and based in Palestine, I’ve learned to build robust systems under pressure. I value results over ego and feedback over perfection.
